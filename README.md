# HeyNotes

**HeyNotes** is a simple, clean, and powerful note-taking application designed for those who want full control over their data. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that lock your data in a proprietary database, HeyNotes stores every note as a **Markdown (.md)** file directly on your device.

## Key Features

### Real File System Integration
Your notes are yours.
* All notes are stored as standard `.md` files.
* Access your notes directly via your phone's File Manager under `Documents > HeyNotes`.
* **Easy Import/Export:** Want to import existing notes? Simply move your `.md` files into the `Documents > HeyNotes` folder, and they will automatically appear in the app.

### Organization & Color Coding
* Create **Folders** to keep your thoughts organized.
* Assign custom **Color Codes** to files and folders to categorize them visually within the app.
* Manage nested notes easily.

### Secure Folders
Protect your private thoughts with the **Secure Folder** feature.
* Lock specific folders with a custom **PIN** (minimum 4 digits).
* **Enhanced Privacy:** Once a folder is secured, it is **hidden from the device's File Manager**. It can only be accessed and viewed through the HeyNotes app after entering your PIN.

## Important Warning Regarding Secure Folders

**Please Read Carefully:**
When you secure a folder, HeyNotes hides it from the file system to prevent unauthorized access via File Managers.

> **Warning:** Because these files are hidden for your security, **uninstalling the app or clearing the app's data may result in the permanent loss of these hidden notes.**
>
> Please ensure you un-secure (unlock) your important folders before uninstalling the app if you wish to keep the `.md` files accessible in your storage.
